Log of steps taken throughout project

21/11/2023
Cloned repo from gitlab using SSH
Removed .venv folder using rmdir .venv /s /q
Created virtual conda environment for project (conda create --name c1_coursework_wp289)
Activated environment (conda activate c1_coursework_wp289)
Exported environment to YAML file (conda env export > environment.yml)
Initialised git (git init in /wp289)
Added env YAML & log file
Pushed to gitlab ("Env & log files created")
Created README
Added MIT license (https://choosealicense.com/) as .txt file and in README
Installed pre-commit (pre-commit hooks)
Installed pytest (testing)
Installed black (formatting)
Installed flake8 (check for PEP8 compliance)

chmod u+x /.git/hooks/pre_commit (not needed with pre-commit)

Added .gitignore to ignore jupyter sandbox file

Set-up pre-commit yaml (from lecture notes)
Note: pre-commit doesn't work with pytest
pre-commit install

Getting error:
An unexpected error has occurred: CalledProcessError: command: ('C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core\\git.EXE', 'fetch', 'origin', '--tags')
return code: 128
stdout: (none)
stderr:
    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
Check the log at C:\Users\William Purvis\.cache\pre-commit\pre-commit.log

Although git SSH key is added succesfully
Commit errors dissapear when pre-commit is uninstalled
Error dissapears when --no-verify is used (suggesting issue with pre-commit setup rather than SSH)

Todo: documentation (sphinx), check with James re: pre-commit

Downloaded sphinx for documentation
Run: to generate documentation
sphinx-apidoc -o docs .

Help: https://redandgreen.co.uk/sphinx/python-code/
Todo: fix documentation, write unit tests

make clean html (to clean HTML)
make html (to make HTML docs)

Fixed documentation! Pushed to gitlab
Updated environment & pushed that to gitlab

Fixed pre-commit
Started work on new branch (backtracking_dev)
Created utils.py folder for utility functions
Added tests for utility functions

Ignored some error codes for flake8:
    E501: line length
    E721: isinstance()
    W503: clashes with Black formatting

Added black & flake8 to pre-commit hooks

To-do:
    documentation formatting
    docker
    check notes to see if anything is missing (?)
    host documentation on gitlab
    investigate other algorithms (constraint satisfaction solvers, donald kuth algotihm x, genetic algorithm, ML techniques)

re-built env

conda env export --from-history  > test_env.yml

todo: rebuild docker, push to v1.0, move on to PDS!!!!!!!!!

Building docker:

docker build -t c1_coursework_wp289 .   (Builds docker image)
docker run -it --name my_c1_project c1_coursework_wp289
run `docker images` on CL to see all images

 To remove all stopped containers, unused networks, and dangling images, run: docker system prune


run in docker: (stop docker using: docker stop sudoku_docker_1 and then docker rm sudoku_docker_1)

docker run -it --name sudoku_docker_1 -v "C:\Users\William Purvis\OneDrive - University of Cambridge\DIS\RC_coursework\wp289\test\example_sudokus:/usr/src/app/data" sudoku_v1 src/main.py /usr/src/app/data/easy_sudoku1.txt
